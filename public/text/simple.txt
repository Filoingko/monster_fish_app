The redtail catfish (Phractocephalus hemioliopterus) got its name due to its bright orange tail fin. This is a good looking, but very large and predatory catfish, that yet is being kept in tanks. It can be seen on sale quite often as well. The redtail catfish grows very large even in small tanks. You’ll need a very roomy tank to keep this fish. It’s a predator, therefore everything it can swallow will be eaten and it can eat quite a lot. General length of the fish reaches 1,8 m (5 ft 11 in) and it weighs 80 kg (180 lb). In tanks the fish tends to grow significantly smaller, but still its size is from 50 cm (20 inches) and to 100 cm (40 inches). The fish lifespan is over 15 years.
